This repository contains homework from Dr. Jojic's deep learning class

This repository also contains homework from Dr. Mohit's NLP class.
some tutorial used in Mohit's class are listed here.
Basic word2vec embedding tutorial [word2vec_1_skipgram ](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/).


Some other better methods such as negative sampling and Subsampling [word2vec_2_sampling](http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/)
